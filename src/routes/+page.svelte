			When I’m bored, I learn new tech. I started off making games and surprisingly won the first
			ever game jam that I participated in (<a href="https://sketchu.itch.io/lit">it was lit</a>).
			After creating more games for a couple of years I discovered Flutter. Launched
			<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amethyst.amethyst_app">an app </a>
			with some friends for connecting musicians which got <em> more than a thousand downloads</em> on
			the play store.

			More recently, I have been exploring machine learning. Plopped a bunch of dinos in the Chrome
			Dinosaur Game to learn to play <a

			>
			themselves. Currently working on
			<a href="https://huggingface.co/BhavyaMuni">a project</a> to create fake songs based on styles
			of top artists.

		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from tech I am also into other nerdy stuff like aerospace, currently working on a design
			team to build <a href="/">a rocket engine</a> (no, we haven't blown up anything as of yet).
			But above all comes my love for COFFEE (yes, I have <a href="/">a coffee journal</a> too).
