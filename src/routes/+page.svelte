<p class="">I’m Bhavya, welcome to my world!</p>
<p>
	When I’m bored, I learn new tech. I started off making games and surprisingly won the first ever
	game jam that I participated in (<a href="https://sketchu.itch.io/lit">it was lit</a>). After
	creating more games for a couple of years I discovered Flutter. Launched
	<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amethyst.amethyst_app">an app </a>
	with some friends for connecting musicians which got <em> more than a thousand downloads</em> on the
	play store.
</p>
<p>
	More recently, I have been exploring machine learning. Plopped a bunch of dinos in the Chrome
	Dinosaur Game to learn to play <a href="https://github.com/BhavyaMuni/ChromeDinoNeuroevolution"
		>the game</a
	>
	themselves. Currently working on
	<a href="https://huggingface.co/BhavyaMuni">a project</a> to create fake songs based on styles of top
	artists.
</p>
<p class="">
	<a href="/projects" class="font-semibold no-underline hover:underline">👾 Projects -&gt</a>
</p>
<p>
	Apart from tech I am also into other nerdy stuff like aerospace, currently working on a design
	team to build <a href="/">a rocket engine</a> (no, we haven't blown up anything as of yet).
	<!-- But above all comes my love for COFvercelFEE (yes, I have <a href="/">a coffee journal</a> too). -->
