		<p class="">I’m Bhavya, welcome to my world!</p>
		<p>
			When I’m bored, I learn new tech. I started off making games in and surprisingly won the first
			ever game jam that I participated in (the game and it’s showcase). After creating more games
			for a couple of years I discovered Flutter. Launched an app with some friends for connecting
			musicians which got more than a thousand downloads on the play store.

		<p>
			More recently, I have been exploring machine learning. Plopped a bunch of dinos in the Chrome
			Dinosaur Game to learn to play the game themselves. Currently working on a project to create
			fake songs based on styles of top artists.
		</p>

			Apart from tech I am also into other nerdy stuff like aerospace, currently working on a design
			team to build a rocket engine (no, we haven’t blown up anything as of yet). But above all
			comes my love for COFFEE (yes, I have a coffee journal too).
